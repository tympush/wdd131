I, and I alone, shall have the authority to stand in judgement over them. No other commander shall they have in battle nor in service.

                    <p class="reference">— Ancient declaration made by the Emperor of Mankind during the Age of Strife</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Adeptus Custodes, known as the Legio Custodes during the era of the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, and colloquially as the "Ten Thousand," is the Imperial adepta responsible for protecting the Imperial Palace and the physical body of the Emperor of Mankind, as well as serving as His most important emissaries, His companions, and the keepers of His many secrets. The Custodes is an elite cadre of genetically-engineered transhuman male and female warriors who are even more potent in combat than the Adeptus Astartes. They are to the Space Marines as the Emperor is to His primarchs, and it is rumoured that each was created by the Master of Mankind personally. His might permeates them, burns in their eyes and flows through their veins as surely as their blood. As such, the Adeptus Custodes are widely regarded as the deadliest warriors in the galaxy, Human or otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Where Space Marines represent the mass-produced, genetically-engineered soldiers of the Imperium of Man, the Adeptus Custodes are a force of individual warriors, each a bastion in their own right and a sentinel of unmatched capability and singular purpose created to counter any possible threat -- Human, alien or Daemonic. These warriors have stood in the presence of the immortal Emperor of Mankind since before the time of the Unification Wars. For ten thousand Terran years and more, the Custodians have stood watch over their lord and master, serving as the Emperor's personal heralds and praetorian bodyguard.</p>
                    <p>During the Great Crusade these resplendent warriors guarded the Emperor wherever He went and swore to give their lives to protect His. After His incarceration in the Golden Throne following the Horus Heresy ten standard millennia ago, they have taken a far more limited role in the Imperium of Man. They almost never leave Terra and only very rarely are seen outside the Imperial Palace as they watch over their recumbent master and patrol the precincts of the Emperor's palace, ever vigilant of threats. It is only the Adeptus Custodes who decide who may enter the Sanctum Imperialis of the Emperor at the heart of the Inner Palace, and when they may do so.</p>
                    <p>With the birth of the Great Rift in the Era Indomitus, and the resurrection of Primarch Roboute Guilliman as the lord commander of the Imperium and Imperial Regent, the Adeptus Custodes have been forced to take a more active role in galactic affairs. A force of Custodians has followed Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade out into the galaxy, often serving as the heralds of a Torchbearers fleet bringing the Primaris creation technology to existing Space Marine Chapters.</p>
                    <p>This was done both to reassure the existing Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes that the gift of the Primaris Space Marines was ordained by the will of the Emperor, but also because in this new era of constant threat, the Custodes have come to a hard realisation: sometimes, the best defence is found on offence.</p>

                    <p class="quote">"We are the Ultramarines, the sons of Guilliman. Whilst we draw breath, we stand. Whilst we stand, we fight. Whilst we fight, we prevail. Nothing shall stay our wrath."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Ultramarines are considered one of the strongest and most honoured of all the Space Marine Chapters in the Imperium of Man, and were responsible for almost single-handedly holding the Imperium together after the Horus Heresy.</p>
                    <p>Highly-disciplined and courageous warriors, the Ultramarines have remained true to the teachings of Primarch Roboute Guilliman for 10,000 standard years. The Ultramarines were originally the XIIIth Space Marine Legion before the reforms that initiated the Second Founding and reshaped the Imperium after the Heresy in the Time of Rebirth on the orders of Guilliman himself as the lord commander of the Imperium and Imperial Regent.</p>
                    <p>The name "Ultramarines" is a nod to the Chapter's galactic region of origin, its standing amongst the other Space Marine Chapters and their role as the source for the gene-seed of more Chapters of Astartes than any of the other former First Founding Legions combined.</p>
                    <p>The culture of the Ultramarines is loosely themed upon the culture of Old Earth's ancient Roman Empire, as exemplified in their Astartes' High Gothic names and their strict adherence to the Codex Astartes, as well as the society of their homeworld of Macragge and the Chapter's method of recruitment.</p>
                    <p>The Ultramarines directly rule the sub-sector of space in the Segmentum Ultima of the galactic east known as Ultramar as a fief of the Imperium and their Chapter Master is also considered the Lord of Macragge and the Master of Ultramar.</p>
                    <p>Of all the thousand and more Space Marine Chapters in the Imperium, it is the blue-clad Ultramarines that, in the mind of the countless billions of the Emperor's subjects, personify everything that the Adeptus Astartes stands for.</p>
                    <p>The Ultramarines and their many Successor Chapters have stood at the very forefront of the war against the Traitor, the alien, and the Daemon since the very foundation of the Imperium. Across the domains of the Emperor, the Ultramarines are celebrated as heroic, virtuous, and noble defenders of Humanity, their deeds recorded in devotional works the length and breadth of the galaxy.</p>
                    <p>Even amongst the Space Marine Chapters themselves, the Ultramarines occupy a position of special honour. The gene-seed from which the original Ultramarines Legion was founded is considered the purest, and it is estimated that some two-thirds of Chapters across the galaxy share their inheritance, being either direct successors or created from tithed Ultramarines genetic material. This shared inheritance often ensures that when the Ultramarines go to war, they are supported by many other Chapters, and that when Space Marine commanders gather to consider common strategy, the counsel of the Ultramarines is greatly valued.</p>
                    <p>Often, the presence of even a small number of Ultramarines units in a larger military undertaking will ensure the participation of many more Chapters, so highly are the sons of Roboute Guilliman held in their brothers' esteem.</p>
                    <p>When Hive Fleet Behemoth struck the Eastern Fringe, it was the Ultramarines Chapter that turned the tide, even at the cost of the Chapter's entire 1st Company. At the Chapter homeworld of Macragge, one of the largest battles seen in centuries was fought, with the Ultramarines, led by their Master Marneus Calgar, at the very forefront. In addition to the great honour won by the Chapter in that titanic struggle, the Ultramarines gained invaluable experience in fighting these vile xenos, which they have passed on, often via service in the Deathwatch, to many other Chapters.</p>
                    <p>When the Horus Heresy struck, Guilliman was leading his mighty Legion in a massive campaign in the galactic south. So successful was the campaign that the Legion had been carried far from the Imperium's heart, so that by the time Guilliman received word of the Warmaster Horus' treachery, the Siege of Terra was underway. The Ultramarines fought their way towards Terra, and although they defeated a massive Traitor space ﬂeet, were unable to intervene in the final battle. It is Guilliman's actions subsequent to the Horus Heresy that made him the figure of adoration that he would become. With the Traitors scattered and the Emperor to all intents and purposes lost to Humanity, the Imperium stood at the precipice.</p>
                    <p>It was the genius and leadership of Roboute Guilliman that saw the Imperium through its first century after the Heresy, as he kept invaders at bay and saved the scattered Human worlds from collapsing into anarchy, reforming the Imperial bureaucracy and armed forces as needed.</p>
                    <p>Roboute Guilliman fell at the hands of his erstwhile brother, the Daemon Primarch Fulgrim of the Emperor's Children Traitor Legion, at the Battle of Thessala in 121.M31. Poisoned unto death, Guilliman's barely living body was placed in a stasis field, and later enthroned in the Ultramarines' fortress-monastery. There it remained for ten thousand years, until he was resurrected by a combination of Imperial science and Aeldari mysticism during the 13th Black Crusade in ca. 999.M41. He would take up the mantle of the Lord Commander of the Imperium once more, and now leads the defence of Mankind from the darkness brought by the birth of the Great Rift.</p>
                    <p>The Ultramarines are by far the best known and most celebrated Adeptus Astartes Chapter in the long and bloody history of the Imperium of Man. Statues of their primarch and their greatest heroes rear high above countless plazas and city gates, and images of their myriad victories glow from stained glass windows in the mightiest basilicas imperialis.</p>
                    <p>The Ultramarines Legion was the largest of those bodies raised to prosecute the Great Crusade so long ago, and as a result it provided the largest number of Chapters when the Second Founding occurred in the aftermath of the Horus Heresy. In addition, the Chapter's gene-seed is generally held to be the purest of all the Adeptus Astartes, and it is so stable that even 10,000 standard years after its inception, mutation is well within tolerable limits. For this reason, a majority of Space Marines Chapters extant in the 41st Millennium are thought to be related to the Ultramarines, whether either is aware of it or not, and as such, inheritors of all that made that Legion so great.</p>
                    <p>The Ultramarines Chapter is at once the exemplar of everything a Space Marine aspires to, and the template by which he acts, fights and worships. Every Chapter has its own traditions, histories and battle-honours, but the Ultramarines are the standard by which many others, especially those of their genetic lineage, judge themselves and their peers, whether they acknowledge it or not.</p>
                    <p>It is through the dictates of the Codex Astartes that the 10,000 Terran years of wisdom and expertise gleaned by the Ultramarines are enshrined. This vast reserve of lore was authored by the Ultramarines primarch, Roboute Guilliman himself, wherein he laid the foundations of the Imperium's reformation during the Time of Rebirth in the aftermath of the calamitous wars of the Horus Heresy. Guilliman was a leader of prodigious intellect, and not just in the military fields. With the Imperium brought to its knees by galactic civil war, he turned his mind to uniting and codifying the highest echelons of the Imperium's government, imposing order on institutions that had been split asunder by the anarchy of the Heresy. Only a primarch, a gene-son of the Emperor Himself could have conceived such an undertaking, for the scattered Imperial worlds that had survived the Heresy were on their knees, riven with plague and famine and rife for rebellion or invasion.</p>
                    <p>The task was gargantuan, and no mere mortal man could have faced it without going mad. Guilliman offered leadership and hope, and he became a figurehead for the reborn Imperium. Countless billions came to know his name, and while he could never replace their beloved Emperor, Guilliman was a firm hand when it was needed most, and the Imperium endured.</p>
                    <p>In committing his wisdom to the first volumes of the Codex Astartes, Guilliman must have known that he would not see his most cherished ambitions fulfilled. After all, none had ever imagined that a primarch might know death, but the Heresy had seen several slain or otherwise lost, and in the years that followed more would suffer similar fates. When Guilliman was lost to the Imperium, he left behind him countless works of wisdom and insight, and the greatest of these was the Codex Astartes. Though the Imperium would again rise to heights rivalling those of the Great Crusade, and descend to depths of despair as dark as the Horus Heresy, Roboute Guilliman's wisdom would prevail.</p>
                    <p>The Ultramarines were and are the guardians of that wisdom, and the exemplars of all their primarch embodied. The Codex Astartes has become a sacred text for them, a blueprint describing the ideals by which the majority of Chapters organise themselves, fight, recruit, train and operate.</p>
                    <p>The Ultramarines rule over a region of space called Ultramar, an autonomous realm that owes no tithes to the Imperium and looks entirely to its own defence. The peoples of the various worlds of Ultramar look to the Ultramarines as both beneficent rulers and as distant figures of legend. While the vast majority of Humanity will never even see a Space Marine, let alone speak to one, the people of Ultramar are more familiar with these mighty warriors. Some even have the honour of being distantly related to one, perhaps some distant ancestor having been accepted into the Chapter. The Ultramarines regard it as their sacred duty to rule their domains justly, and to protect them as the source of their recruiting and resources. In this the Ultramarines are continuing the legacy of their primarch, whose teachings each warrior studies and memorises over the course of his service.</p>
                    <p>The Codex Astartes is such a vast body of wisdom that even the prodigious, genetically-enhanced mental capacity of a Space Marine is taxed with absorbing it all. Yet the Ultramarines regard it as their duty to do so, and choose to eschew the blunt tool of psycho-conditioning in favour of learning every passage by remorseless study.</p>
                    <p>Each battle-brother absorbs and analyses entire chapters of the Codex, so that after several standard centuries of service he is at once a master and a scholar of his chosen area of expertise. Within a company, especially a low-numbered one consisting of numerous long-service Veterans, it is likely that the entire Codex Astartes will be known by the battle-brothers, allowing its commanding captain to draw upon an enormous pool of wisdom as well as experience. A Veteran Ultramarines battle-brother is therefore a deeply learned individual, schooled in every nuance of the arts of war and the wisdom of his primarch.</p>

                    <p class="quote">"Since the founding of their Legion at the birth of the Imperium, the Space Marines of the Dark Angels have been dreaded by their enemies and held in awe by those they protect. Stubborn and relentless in battle, ever vigilant and zealous in their pursuit of their duties, the Dark Angels are among the Emperor's most faithful servants. Yet, it was not always so. For ten millennia the Dark Angels have harboured a sinister secret, an act so terrible and shameful it threatens everything the Dark Angels hold most dear – and may yet bring them eternal damnation."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— Inquisitor Bastalek Grim</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Dark Angels are considered amongst the most powerful and secretive of the Loyalist Space Marine Chapters. They were the Ist Legion of the original 20 Space Marine Legions to be created during the First Founding of the 30th Millennium.</p>
                    <p>Though they claim complete allegiance and service to the Emperor of Mankind, their actions and secret goals at times seem at odds with that professed loyalty, as the Dark Angels strive above all other things to atone for an ancient crime of betrayal committed over 10,000 standard years ago against the trust of the Emperor during the time of the Horus Heresy.</p>
                    <p>The Dark Angels stand first amongst the Space Marine Chapters, as they have done since their very inception as the Ist Legion. They are a proud Chapter, with traditions and rituals that date back to the earliest days of the Imperium of Man.</p>
                    <p>The origins of the Dark Angels remain shrouded in mystery. Few Imperial records of the Chapter's beginnings still exist, nor are there many mentions of the part it played in the Emperor's Great Crusade during the early 31st Millennium. Most references in the histories of the Imperium to its deeds during the accursed times of the Horus Heresy have actually been expunged.</p>
                    <p>Yet a legend persists that at one point the Dark Angels teetered on the very brink of heresy and that an act of the most terrible betrayal dishonoured all of the Ist Legion's feats of valour, leaving an enduring stain upon all of its Successor Chapters' honour.</p>
                    <p>Such is their shame that from that time onwards, the Dark Angels and their Unforgiven successors, of which there are more than 19 currently in Imperial service, strive for absolution from the sins of millennia past.</p>
                    <p>The Dark Angels' terrible secret is this: during the Horus Heresy, some of their brethren were turned to the side of Chaos. The Renegades were defeated in a battle that destroyed the Dark Angels' Legion homeworld, Caliban, but many of the Traitor Dark Angels survived to be cast through space and time by the direct intervention of the Chaos Gods.</p>
                    <p>These survivors are known to those few Dark Angels granted knowledge of their existence as the "Fallen Angels" or just "The Fallen." In the eyes of the Chapter's leaders, there is only one way that the Chapter can ever atone for its shame, restoring its honour and trust in the eyes of the Emperor -- all of the Fallen must be found and either made to repent their ancient sin, or slain.</p>
                    <p>This story of treachery and betrayal is the Dark Angels' hidden shame, and their secret mission to destroy all of the Fallen is now their only hope of salvation. No one knows of this other than the Dark Angels, their Successor Chapters and, perhaps, the Emperor Himself, interred within His Golden Throne.</p>
                    <p>The Chapter has been shaped by its dark past and is secretive and monastic in nature, with much time given over to worship and prayer. There are many different levels within the Chapter which individuals may gradually rise through. On attaining each new level, they are granted a little more knowledge of the truth behind the Dark Angels' origins, but only the highest-ranking members of the Chapter, the members of what is known as the "Inner Circle," know the terrible, shameful secret of what occurred 10,000 Terran years ago.</p>
                    <p>The Dark Angels hold more battle honours than almost any other Chapter; its only equals are its own successors. The Chapter has fought the length and breadth of the Imperium and beyond; against every foe that has ever beset Mankind. Dark Angels have held Ork WAAAGH!s at bay, crushed planetary uprisings, and saved entire star systems from the incursions of the Ruinous Powers.</p>
                    <p>They have fought across searing deserts, in the cold void of space, in dense carnivorous alien jungles, and in the depths of the wildest underhives. Yet, while Chapters such as the Blood Angels and the Ultramarines are lauded wherever they fight, the Dark Angels shun laurels and turn their backs upon adulation.</p>
                    <p>Even though the Chapter has stood side by side with every major arm of the Imperium's military, it has always maintained a distance and aloofness that sets its brethren further apart from the bulk of Humanity, and even from other Space Marines. When the Dark Angels join a larger force to execute a great war or Imperial Crusade, they do so according to their own, unfathomable goals. When a Dark Angels force is committed to such a conﬂict, it invariably remains aloof.</p>
                    <p>Its officers keep their own counsel on matters of tactics and strategy, and prefer to maintain their own lines of communication and supply sources. Even when dealing with the battle-brothers of other Astartes Chapters, the Dark Angels often remain sullenly quiet at the Space Marine command councils and tactical briefings, though that is not to suggest that they are any less effective on the battlefield.</p>
                    <p>When the Dark Angels do undertake joint operations alongside other Chapters, it is quite common for them to do so with others amongst the so-called "Unforgiven" -- the Successor Chapters of the original Dark Angels Legion. The successors of the Ist Legion maintain especially close relations, their officers all being members of the Inner Circle.</p>
                    <p>This mysterious body provides a ready-made command network that the Unforgiven Chapters can utilise to great effect when coordinating their activities. There is no presumption that the leaders of the Dark Angels have any inherent superiority over those of the other Unforgiven Chapters. Rather, the leaders work together closely, and if needed elect one of their number as nominal commander for the duration of the campaign.</p>
                    <p>In one matter, however, the officers of the Dark Angels have superiority over those of the other Unforgiven Chapters, through the workings of the Inner Circle -- the Hunt for the Fallen. When hunting those turncoat Dark Angels who escaped the Fall of Caliban, the Unforgiven operate under the auspices of the highest-ranked of the Inner Circle, and the very highest of these is the Supreme Grand Master himself -- the Chapter Master of the Dark Angels.</p>
                    <p>Through the machinations of the Unforgiven's Inner Circle, its members are eternally vigilant, never resting in the hunt for the Fallen. Even though knowledge of the Fallen is withheld from the majority of the brethren, the results of post-battle debriefings and psi-induced stress-purges are fed back to the Inner Circle and any sign of the presence of a Fallen analysed.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the Dark Angels' Chaplains are permanently attached to a company, and this allows them to hear the confessions of their brothers and to keep a close watch for signs of the Fallen. When such traces are discovered, the Inner Circle moves without hesitation, redeploying Unforgiven forces wherever they happen to be and re-tasking them with their new target.</p>
                    <p>In most cases, it is the Ravenwing that locates such activity and the Deathwing that delivers the killing blow, but on occasion, entire Dark Angels strike forces have been recalled from campaigns and committed to engage an enemy that only the highest-ranked of its officers have any true knowledge of.</p>
                    <p>While a great deal of the Unforgiven's efforts and resources are committed to the Hunt for the Fallen, the majority of the brethren have no knowledge of the matter. Rather, the Dark Angels and their successors are constantly warned against the words of the Heretic and their Chapter dogma extols the virtues of the eternal hunt for those who would foreswear the most powerful of oaths.</p>
                    <p>The company Chaplains preach sermons that tell of legendary figures betrayed by their own, often having fought in battles far from home. Numerous such tales exist, and each is revealed as part of a slow, deliberate pattern, the brethren monitored all the while for their reaction.</p>
                    <p>Only upon his ascension to the Inner Circle is a battle-brother told anything approaching the truth, and even then, there are some secrets known only at the very highest tiers. How much of the shame of the Dark Angels a battle-brother knows depends upon his station within the Chapter and how far the agents of the Inner Circle trust him.</p>
                    <p>He may have fought the Fallen unwittingly, believing his foe yet another vile Traitor worthy only of death. Perhaps his sergeant knew more, certainly his company master did, but he himself almost certainly would not.</p>
                    <p>Conversely, there are some higher-ranked brethren who despite exemplary service are never inducted into the Inner Circle. Perhaps the company Chaplains harbour some small doubt or have reason to believe the individual would not be able to bear the terrible truth of what occurred during the Horus Heresy. Such Astartes are unlikely to progress much further, for at the highest levels of authority the Chapter is ever engaged upon the Hunt for the Fallen.</p>

                    <p class="quote">"They are the sons of the Angel, the blooded host, the defenders of Humanity. They are strength. They are nobility. They are the Blood Angels, and I say to you there are no more loyal or determined servants of the Emperor alive today."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— High Lord Baldus Bael to Ordo Astartes Inquisitor Neizallkin following the Grand Accusation</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Blood Angels are one of the 20 First Founding Legions of the Space Marines and were originally the IXth Legion before the Second Founding broke the Legiones Astartes up into separate Chapters of 1,000 Space Marines each.</p>
                    <p>They are well-known across the galaxy for their bloodthirsty nature in battle, and feared for the curse of flawed gene-seed they carry. The Blood Angels are amongst the longest-living of the Adeptus Astartes, with some of the Chapter's Space Marines having served the Emperor of Mankind for over a thousand standard years.</p>
                    <p>Due to recent events, the Blood Angels' numbers were severely depleted. Under the threat of extinction, and in order to quickly replenish their numbers, the Blood Angels were forced to ask their kindred Successor Chapters from subsequent Astartes Foundings for a tithe of warriors from the related Chapters' pools of neophytes, their candidate Space Marines.</p>
                    <p>With these tithes of new recruits, and the recent arrival of the Primaris Space Marines during the Indomitus Crusade, the Blood Angels were able to replenish their losses, though they still face a time of trial like none the Chapter has known since the days of the Horus Heresy.</p>
                    <p>The Blood Angels are the noble descendants of that most puissant and angelic of the primarchs -- Sanguinius. They are perhaps one of the most celebrated Chapters in the entire Imperium, their countless heroic deeds and victories known to untold billions of the Emperor's subjects across the length and breadth of the galaxy.</p>
                    <p>The beauteous, angelic visages of the Chapter's heroes adorn Gothic facades and stained glass windows in a million holy basilicas, and their portraits gaze serenely from endlessly copied and much cherished illuminated tomes.</p>
                    <p>Yet, hidden from the multitudes, the Blood Angels harbour a terrible curse. When their beloved primarch was slain at the hands of the Arch-traitor Horus at the very height of the Horus Heresy, every Blood Angel was doomed to share a portion of the pain inﬂicted upon his ﬂawless form. From that day forth, every Blood Angel has been tormented by visions of the last moment of Sanguinius.</p>
                    <p>The older the Space Marine gets, the more frequent and debilitating such waking nightmares become. Should he not fall in battle, every Blood Angel will one day become so consumed by these soul-searing visions that he will descend into a madness in which he must witness the death of Sanguinius over and over again, ever unable to intervene as the Warmaster enacts his vile treachery.</p>
                    <p>The very inevitability of their curse ennobles the battle-brothers of the Blood Angels, driving them ever onwards to a glorious death in the name of the Emperor and their primarch. Where lesser men might have surrendered to the dark urgings to shed the blood of the enemies of the Emperor, the Blood Angels have remained pure and noble for ten thousand standard years. Despite this, the Chapter is dying, for each year ever more of its brethren succumb to the so-called Red Thirst -- the desire to rend limb from limb those responsible for the death of Sanguinius, and by extension every enemy of the Emperor.</p>
                    <p>The death of Sanguinius represents one of the most perfidious and tragic moments of the Horus Heresy, for he died at the hands of his brother-primarch, the Arch-traitor Horus. Although some say that the sacrifice weakened the Warmaster just enough to allow the Emperor to later defeat him at the climax of the Siege of Terra, the death of Sanguinius is mourned to this day, and felt keenly by the Blood Angels, in whose veins his blood still pumps.</p>
                    <p>When war calls and blood is spilled, the Blood Angels are gripped by a fury born of the last moments of their primarch's life. For some, the thirst is too great and they are entirely overcome by what is called the Black Rage, cursed to end their days reliving their beloved primarch's death over and over again.</p>
                    <p>The beatific Sons of Sanguinius are known and celebrated across the Imperium, representations of the greatest heroes of the Blood Angels carved in marble, painted in oils, and sewn in tapestries in a million cloisters and more. Their angel-winged primarch is an object of veneration on countless worlds, his perfect visage gazing down on the faithful with a mixture of benevolence and pity. The Blood Angels are the inheritors of Sanguinius, and they bring death from above to the enemies of the Emperor.</p>
                    <p>The Chapter seeks the beauty of perfection in all it does, and in one particular field of warfare surpasses all other practitioners. While all Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes are masters of the Drop Pod and Thunderhawk assault, the Blood Angels have become synonymous with the ﬂawless execution of the aerial assault.</p>
                    <p>They employ an entirely new pattern of vehicle of mysterious origins: the Stormraven gunship. This vessel appears as a lighter cousin of the Thunderhawk, and while its smaller size means it carries less weaponry and a smaller troop capacity, it greatly makes up for this in speed and manoeuvrability.</p>
                    <p>While the Adeptus Mechanicus took several standard centuries to examine and debate the use of the Standard Template Construct imprint of the gunship, the Blood Angels saw its worth immediately, and set about introducing it into their armoury.</p>
                    <p>Lately, the Chapter's Forge has been able to perfect its fabrication methods to such an extent that the gunship is now being used throughout the entire force. While the gunship is only just beginning to enter service in other Astartes Chapters, the Blood Angels are already masters of its use, and they have refined methods of aerial assault others are just beginning to learn.</p>
                    <p>The Blood Angels' doctrine of aerial assault culminates in savage close combat. Whether they are delivered into battle by Thunderhawk or Stormraven gunship, or in the troop bay of an armoured transport such as a Rhino, Razorback or Land Raider, the Blood Angels are all but peerless in their mastery of close assault.</p>
                    <p>This is in part because the gene-seed of Sanguinius grants his sons an incredibly long life span even for Space Marines, during which endless solar hours of practise and countless battles hone their skills to perfection. Yet, the Blood Angels are not driven towards the fury of close assault by tactical necessity or battlefield doctrine alone.</p>
                    <p>The Chapter's reliance on blood and the need to cleanse it to keep the Flaw at bay exerts a strange and all but irresistible hold on the Blood Angels. In battle, the Blood Angels are drawn to spill the blood of their foes, and their ordinarily noble countenance can occasionally transform into twisted, rage-fuelled masks of savagery.</p>
                    <p>This is referred to as the Red Thirst, and it is something that every Blood Angel experiences. For many, the Red Thirst is prelude to the ultimate expression of the Flaw, the Black Rage, in which the state becomes permanent and all-consuming.</p>
                    <p>The Blood Angels and their Successor Chapters, known as the "Sanguinary Brotherhood," are unique in that their gene-seed imposes an unusual, and ultimately tragic, ﬂaw upon each battle-brother. For most Chapters, service begins as a neophyte, with the initiate becoming ever more senior the more battles he survives until the few that remain are granted command of a company, become a specialist such as a Chaplain, or even become the Master of the Chapter itself.</p>
                    <p>The Blood Angels experience an entirely different journey, though few outside of their ranks ever learn of it. The Blood Angels possess an almost supernaturally noble, almost saintly countenance, their features handsome and pure.</p>
                    <p>This is all the more amazing because the Chapter recruits from the short and stunted men of the tribes of Baal, riddled with stigmata, lesions, and carcinoma caused by radiation poisoning. Their dramatic transformation into the saintly neophytes is only made possible by arcane bloodrites.</p>
                    <p>Over a lifespan far longer than that of the average Astartes, the Blood Angel hones his skills, yet with each battle he experiences something more of the Flaw, the urge to spill the hot, steaming blood of his foes growing ever stronger.</p>
                    <p>As it does so, the battle-brother is driven to spend longer periods of time purging his own bloodstream within the crimson embrace of his transfusion casket. After several standard centuries of service he must spend long solar hours within it, having every drop of his own blood scrubbed clean.</p>
                    <p>At some point, the Blood Angel is likely to feel the stirrings of something deeper, the rage descending not at the culmination of battle but before it. These are the first echoes of the Black Rage, and while most Blood Angels fall in combat long before succumbing to it, those who cannot hold it at bay are forced to enter the Chapter's infamous Death Company.</p>

                    <p class="quote">"The Sons of Fenris they are, hardened in the forge of their harsh world, eager for battle and honour. They are the grey warriors, ashen like the wolf, whose greatest joy is to hear the clamour of steel amidst the din of war."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— The Space Wolves Catechism</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Space Wolves, known in their own dialect of Juvjk as the Vlka Fenryka or "Wolves of Fenris," are one of the original 20 First Founding Space Marine Chapters, and were once led by their famed primarch, Leman Russ. Originally the VIth Legion of Astartes raised by the Emperor at the dawn of the Great Crusade, the Space Wolves are renowned for their anti-authoritarian ways and their embrace of their homeworld Fenris' savage barbarian culture as well as their extreme deviation from the Codex Astartes in the Chapter's organisation.</p>
                    <p>After the Horus Heresy and the resultant Second Founding reforms of the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Wolves Legion was divided into two Chapters: the new Space Wolves Chapter, which was not compliant with the dictates of the Codex Astartes and retained the name of its parent Space Marine Legion, and the second Chapter which took the name of the Wolf Brothers. The Wolf Brothers suffered from rampant mutation of their gene-seed not long after their Founding and were later disbanded.</p>
                    <p>Only recently in the Era Indomitus have new successors of the Space Wolves been raised; though many Space Wolves still have doubts about whether the Primaris Marines raised from the genetic material of Leman Russ are true sons of the primarch, the Great Wolf Logan Grimnar has accepted them into the fold as warriors worthy of the Wolf King's heritage.</p>
                    <p>Since the Imperium came into being, the Space Wolves have fought tooth and nail for the cause of the Emperor. Amongst the most famous of the Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes in the wider Imperium, their sagas are told from one end of the galaxy to the other. As headstrong as they are fierce, the Space Wolves excel at close-quarters fighting, their warriors vying keenly for glory on the field of battle. The Space Wolves live to fight, and death holds even less fear for them than their counterparts in other Chapters.</p>
                    <p>The legends of the Space Wolves Chapter are told on countless thousands of worlds, and like the greatest of their fellow First Founding kin, they hold so many battle-honours that it would take a battle-scribe an entire lifetime to commit them all to parchment. The manner in which such laurels are won and recounted amongst the Space Wolves is very different to how such things are achieved amongst other Chapters.</p>
                    <p>The Space Wolves are savage and proud, and they seek glory in all they do. Some, especially the Dark Angels, regard the Sons of Russ as braggarts and gloryhounds, finding their methods crude and their desire to make a name for themselves vainglorious. In truth, every Space Wolves battle-brother longs for his story -- his saga -- to be recounted by his kin long after he has fallen, and for his name to be spoken in the same breath as the primarch himself.</p>
                    <p>The Space Wolves deviate from the Codex Astartes and the essential nature of what it is to be a Space Marine about as far as is possible. Their genetic inheritance is at once a blessing and a curse, for although each Space Wolf is gifted of the transhuman senses of Russ himself, their enhanced physiologies can be overcome by the change and a dramatic and terrible mutation can manifest.</p>
                    <p>In organisation, the Chapter has never paid any regard to the dictates of Roboute Guilliman's Codex Astartes, stubbornly cleaving to the structure that saw it through the wars at the very dawn of the Age of the Imperium. In appearance, the Space Wolves are savage and wild, adorning their armour with a combination of finely-wrought talismans and skins, bones, and teeth taken as trophies from beasts they have slain in single combat. Even in their manners, the battle-brothers of the Space Wolves differ from most other Space Marines, for they are competitive and headstrong, and at once individualistic and fiercely loyal to their squad or "pack."</p>
                    <p>Space Wolves seek to write their saga with every deed they perform and every battle they fight, and perhaps more than any other Chapter, their service is an epic in itself. The rites of initiation that a Space Wolf must undergo in order to be accepted as a neophyte are amongst the most harsh of any Chapter. Often he must actually fall in combat having slain all of his foes first, a guttering spark of life remaining.</p>
                    <p>His deeds witnessed by a so-called "Chooser of the Slain," the young warrior awakens far from his tribe. But this is only the beginning, for so potent is the gene-stock of Leman Russ that most who receive it are overcome, their bodies ravaged by mutation as they transform into savage, once-Human beasts called Wulfen.</p>
                    <p>Those who can contain this animal potency are judged fit to proceed, and after countless more trials may be accepted into the ranks of the Blood Claw Assault Packs. At this stage in his life, a Space Wolf is likely to be a headstrong berserker competing with his peers for the approval of his superiors. He is also full of the disdain and reckless overconfidence of youth, convinced that his methods are correct and the older warriors are simply stuck in their ways. Only as he matures with experience, faces more foes and suffers the cathartic tragedy of losing beloved battle-brothers of his pack does he change, and progress to join the Veteran Grey Hunter packs.</p>
                    <p>Later in life, having faced every foe and seen all there is to be seen, the Space Wolf and his few surviving peers might form a Long Fangs pack, where their hard-fought experience and wisdom affords them the ability to provide fire support to the rest of the force, and to act as an immovable island in the seething ocean of battle. Throughout his service, the Space Wolf compiles his great saga, not in words, but in deeds. He seeks out the most powerful of enemies and faces the most arduous of tasks.</p>
                    <p>Every Adeptus Astartes Chapter is a cadre of heroes, and the Space Wolves even more so than most, so to earn a special place in the annals of his Chapter, a Space Wolf must perform truly epic deeds and face such foes as would give even the mightiest of figures pause. As a result of these deeds, each Space Wolf carries within him unparalleled expertise, and wears the scars to prove it.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps more than any other Chapter, the character of a Space Wolves battle-brother is defined by his age. Perhaps the changes wrought within him by the Canis Helix grant him something of the essence of his primarch, a potent and savage nature the battle-brother must struggle to control. Leman Russ was known as a being of wild humours and often contradictory drives. One moment he was jovial, the next sullen. At the conclusion of one battle he might have ordered clemency and mercy, and at another brooked no quarter.</p>
                    <p>To the Space Wolves, there is no contradiction, for the very world that birthed them, Fenris, is subject to such extremes. One season the land of ice and fire is cold and snow-swept, the next the skies blacken with ash and lava ﬂows dissect the plains. Thus, the nature and character of a Space Wolf depends very much upon his stage in life. The youngest are headstrong and cocksure, seemingly determined to get themselves killed charging headlong into battle.</p>
                    <p>The Grey Hunters are more mature, knowing the constraints of their abilities but confident of their skills. The Long Fangs are the oldest and the wisest, affably disapproving of the antics of the youngsters but ever ready with words of advice. The most skilled in battle and leadership of whatever age serve as Wolf Guard, the guardians of the Chapter's mightiest heroes. Whatever his station, a Space Wolf knows that he travels a glorious path, and that thousands of great warriors have trod it before him.</p>

                    <p class="quote">"Let the power of your Knight flow through your veins. Let the ghosts of your throne whisper wisdom into your mind. Let steel be your sinews and fire be your fists. Become your Knight, as it becomes you, and through symbiosis ascend. So shall you become. So shall you protect your people and slaughter your foes."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— Sixth Canticle of the Ritual of Becoming</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Imperial Knights, or Questor Imperialis in High Gothic, are piloted robotic combat walkers of small to medium size in the service of the Imperium and sometimes the Adeptus Mechanicus.</p>
                    <p>Each Knight is piloted by a single Human warrior drawn from an ancient feudal aristocratic culture that stretches across the galaxy.</p>
                    <p>However, a Knight is smaller and less capable in combat than even the smallest class of true Titan utilised by the Collegia Titanica, the Warhound-class Scout Titan. Knights normally deploy in squadrons comprised of several of these war machines.</p>
                    <p>These ancient battlesuits stand thirty to forty Terran feet (9 to 12 metres) tall, are protected by nearly impenetrable Ion Shields and armed with a devastating array of heavy weapons.</p>
                    <p>Imperial Knights are colossal war machines that tower over the battlefield. They are propelled into battle by powerful servos and have the power to kick over tanks and crush soldiers into red paste.</p>
                    <p>Vulnerable limbs and joints are protected by sweeping armour plates of adamantium and supported by an incorporated Ion Shield which responds to the thought-commands of its Noble pilot. The presence of just one of these towering engines of destruction is enough to change the course of a battle, and only the Titans of the Adeptus Mechanicus are more feared by the enemies of Mankind.</p>
                    <p>Knights are not mere war machines, but relics from a lost age, armoured giants from a forgotten era. One does not drive such an heirloom -- it must be bonded with. Only a Noble from an ancestral knightly house may have such an honour.</p>
                    <p>During a strange and terrible rite known as the Ritual of Becoming, the Noble fuses their mind with the Machine Spirit of the Knight -- a union of flesh and metal. Only then can the Noble truly occupy the Throne Mechanicum -- the seat of control from which they use his mind to command the towering Knight.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of standard years before the rise of the Imperium, Mankind reached out to the stars and settled many far away worlds. Among the apparatus of colonisation were formidable war machines known as "Knights," which existed to protect the settlers from any threat.</p>
                    <p>The strongholds constructed from the remains of ancient Terran colony starships are ruled by the descendants of the first Human settlers of those far-flung worlds, mighty fighters who go to war in their towering armoured battlesuits and who are sworn to protect and guard the Imperial citizens who now inhabit their worlds.</p>
                    <p>These proud and haughty warriors can trace their bloodlines back to Terra itself and are colloquially known as "Nobles" or "Scions" in Imperial society and as the Questoris Familia in formal High Gothic.</p>
                    <p>Over the millennia, the pilots of these massive war suits have established a rich culture, Noble houses each sworn to the defence of their homeworld, bound by oaths of fealty to the Golden Throne of Terra and the Adeptus Mechanicus of Mars.</p>
                    <p>Knight armour comes in a wide variety of forms, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The two most commonly seen types are the Knight Paladin and the Knight Errant. These both use the same basic body form, but are fitted with different weapon arrays. Each is well-liked for its balanced and deadly combination of manoeuvrability, protection and firepower.</p>
                    <p>All Imperial Knights are protected by thick adamantium armour and are fitted with powerful weapon systems. Usually, this entails two primary weapons, one attached to each of its "arms," which will be supplemented by a number of secondary weapon systems fitted to its body and shoulders.</p>
                    <p>The hand-forged armour that protects each Knight was crafted long ago, and elements such as the individual armour plates, helm or crests can therefore vary considerably depending on the skill of the artisan who made them.</p>
                    <p>The armour is often lavishly detailed and adorned with complex heraldry that reveals the Knight's allegiances and the deeds he has accomplished in battle.</p>
                    <p>In addition to their weaponry, all Knights carry potent defensive field generators called Ion Shields. This ancient technology works by projecting an energy field across a narrow arc to the front of the Knight.</p>
                    <p>By quickly moving the position of the shield so that it intercepts enemy attacks, a Knight is able to survive even the heaviest fire, whilst still being able to fire its own weapons in return.</p>
                    <p>The exact setting and positioning of the shield is essential, as the Ion Shield is only designed to deflect and slow shots, rather than absorb them in the manner of the far more powerful void shields used on Imperial Titans. This means the effectiveness of the shield is partially dependent on the skill and experience of its operator.</p>
                    <p>Both the Knight Paladin and Knight Errant are traditionally equipped with enormous melee weapons and are famed for their skill with them, charging into the enemy and delivering blows left and right with their massive Reaper Chainswords.</p>
                    <p>This impressive close combat capability is supported with powerful ranged weapons that can blast apart enemy vehicles, and Heavy Stubbers to mow down infantry targets.</p>
                    <p>Other, much rarer, types of Knight armour are used on some Knight Worlds. Amongst the heaviest types of Knight armour made by the Forge Worlds are the Crusader and the Castellan. Although slower than other suit types, these two benefit from substantially increased firepower and much thicker armour, and are instead used in a fire support role.</p>
                    <p>The Lancer is a faster version of a standard Knight suit. These agile machines are used to outflank the enemy, scout out their defences and distract hostile forces while slower units get into position to attack. This type of armour is sophisticated and extremely difficult to manufacture, and its use is therefore usually reserved for rulers of knightly houses, or for Nobles that have proven themselves worthy of it in the fires of victory.</p>
                    <p>However, while the Crusader, Castellan and Lancer are rightly revered, the Paladin and Errant's perfectly balanced combination of speed, firepower and armour make them the supreme examples of Knight design.</p>

He needed a weapon that would never bite the hand that feeds. The World Eaters were not that weapon. We've all drawn blades purely for the sake of shedding blood, and we've all felt the exultation of winning a war that never even needed to happen. We are not the tame, reliable pets that the Emperor wanted. The Wolves obey, when we would not. The Wolves can be trusted, when we never could. They have a discipline we lack, because their passions are not aflame with the Butcher's Nails buzzing in the back of their skulls. The Wolves will always come to heel when called. In that regard, it is a mystery why they name themselves wolves. They are tame, collared by the Emperor, obeying His every whim. But a wolf doesn't behave that way. Only a dog does. That is why we are the Eaters of Worlds, and the War Hounds no longer."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— Captain Khârn of the World Eaters Legion's 8th Assault Company, from his unpublished treatise The Eighteen Legions</p>
                    <p><br><br>The World Eaters are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines who now inhabit the Warp rift known as the Eye of Terror in the Imperium of Man's Segmentum Obscurus.</p>
                    <p>The World Eaters, originally known as the War Hounds, were also once the XIIth Legion of the twenty First Founding Space Marine Legions, and one of the first to betray the Emperor of Mankind for the service of Chaos and the Warmaster Horus.</p>
                    <p>This Legion was a collection of nearly inhuman monsters long before Horus became corrupted and monsters they would remain, only with what little remained of their restraint and their Humanity stripped away after their fall to Chaos.</p>
                    <p>The World Eaters are now the dedicated servants of the Blood God Khorne, the Chaos God of war and murder, and live for nothing more than to spill blood in his name. The World Eaters' Primarch Angron was one of the first of the Space Marine Primarchs to join with Horus when he turned against the Emperor and began the Horus Heresy.</p>
                    <p>The Legion is no longer united, having long ago surrendered to the pure bloodlust inspired by their patron Khorne. Instead they now operate as separate warbands of Chaos Space Marines who seek to spread death and terror in the name of the Blood God across the galaxy.</p>
                    <p>The World Eaters were known from their very inception as the most brutal and direct of assault troops. Their fearsome doctrine was very much the result of the early life of their Primarch.</p>
                    <p>Angron was raised on the world of Nuceria as a slave-warrior, driven by a cybernetic cranial implant called the Butcher's Nails into savage bouts of uncontrollable violence for the entertainment of the masses.</p>
                    <p>But Angron did not remain a slave for long, for he was possessed of the indomitable will of a Primarch, and he rallied his fellow gladiators to break the chains of their bondage, slay their oppressors and escape to freedom.</p>
                    <p>Having led his army of escaped slave-warriors into the mountains, Angron found himself hunted relentlessly, until only a thousand or so of his companions survived, cornered by five entire armies of Nucerian overseers. Determined to sell their lives dearly, Angron and his warriors dug their own graves, a signal to the enemy that no quarter would be asked and the fight would be to the death.</p>
                    <p>But Angron was not to fall the following morning, for it transpired that the Emperor had been observing his deeds from orbit. The Emperor came before His long lost gene-son and told him, as He had the other Primarchs, of the purpose for which he was created. Yet Angron rejected the Emperor's words, determined instead to fight and to die at the side of his fellow slave-warriors.</p>
                    <p>As the sun rose and the encircling armies closed on Angron's band of warriors, the Emperor saw that not even a mighty Primarch could prevail against such odds. As battle was joined, the Primarch was teleported to the Emperor's vessel, and though he was saved from certain death as all his comrades died in his absence, he never forgave his gene-father for what he would forever view as a gross betrayal of a warrior's vows to his battle-kin.</p>
                    <p>Taking his position as Primarch of the XIIth Legion, which he renamed the "World Eaters," Angron instigated a program of replicating the cranial implants he himself had been fitted with as a slave-warrior, knowing that the devices granted such advantages in speed, aggression and strength that no enemy in the galaxy could stand before his Legion once all had received them.</p>
                    <p>Yet, it was soon found that the implants were based on lost technology of which the ancient Mechanicum was ignorant, and while they used Angron's own implant as a template, they were never able to fully recreate it.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the Mechanicum did succeed in creating devices that greatly boosted the abilities of the bearer, making him stronger and even more aggressive than he already was. The World Eaters became the most effective shock troops in the Imperium's armies, proving time and again that none could stand before them.</p>
                    <p>Yet, the glories came at a price, for the aggression unlocked by the implants proved all but impossible to temper once given full reign, and at the world of Ghenna, an entire planetary population was butchered in a single solar night by World Eaters unable or unwilling to deny the bloodlust unleashed by the implants. Angron was censured, and ordered by the Emperor to cease the practise of implanting his warriors in such a way, yet he continued regardless.</p>
                    <p>When the Horus Heresy erupted, Angron's Legion was at the very forefront of the bloodshed. Most notably, the World Eaters led the assault upon the walls of the Imperial Palace, taking the breach with no regards to their own losses. By this point, the World Eaters had given full vent to their most destructive urges.</p>
                    <p>While Angron had once been a great man possessed of a fearsome sense of martial pride and honour, now he was a frothing, blood-soaked berserker Daemon Prince, as were his warriors. Any reason that had survived the implant process was driven from their minds, replaced with the will of Khorne, the Blood God.</p>
                    <p>It is said that when the Emperor defeated Horus and the hordes of Chaos assaulting Terra were finally routed, the World Eaters were the last of their number to quit the field of battle.</p>
                    <p>None can say how close the World Eaters came to destroying the palace, or whether they would have come face to face with the Emperor Himself had not Horus lowered the shields of his Battle Barge, precipitating the final confrontation in orbit.</p>
                    <p>In the aftermath of the Horus Heresy, the World Eaters descended to new depths of bloodlust and destruction, reaving across the already shattered Imperium before plunging into the twisted depths of the Eye of Terror. None can say exactly what happened within the Eye, but it is apparent that the Legion all but consumed itself in a bitter internecine conﬂict that saw it fractured into countless smaller warbands.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the Blood God was pleased with the slaughter, for Angron had already been raised up to become a Daemon Prince, even as his Legion ceased to exist as a coherent whole.</p>
                    <p>Though its Daemon Primarch would periodically gather the disparate warbands into something resembling the glory of the old Legion, the World Eaters were condemned to roam the battlefields of the galaxy in search of war, individual squads and warbands joining other Chaos forces and fighting for nothing more than the opportunity to spill blood and take skulls.</p>

                    <p class="quote">"In the embrace of great Nurgle, I am no longer afraid, for with His pestilential favour I have become that which I once feared: Death."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— Kulvain Hestarius of the Death Guard</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Death Guard are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines. They worship and devote themselves exclusively to the Chaos God Nurgle and as a result of his mutational "gifts" they have become Plague Marines; Heretic Astartes who are eternally rotting away within their power armour and infected with every known form of disease and decay but who are immune to all pain or minor injury.</p>
                    <p>When the XIVth Legion was first raised on Terra by the Emperor during the First Founding, its Astartes were known as the Dusk Raiders. After the XIVth Legion was reunited with its Primarch Mortarion on the world of Barbarus, he renamed the Legion the Death Guard.</p>
                    <p>The Death Guard are a Traitor Legion entirely steeped in the power of Nurgle, the Chaos God of death, disease and despair, their very essence the epitome of all that vile Chaos God stands for. Their bodies are hives of filth and decay, their ﬂesh eternally rotting away even as it is renewed by the ceaseless process of death and rebirth.</p>
                    <p>Once, however, the Death Guard were the strongest and most resilient of all of the Emperor's Space Marine Legions, the inheritors of Primarch Mortarion in whose genetic image they were created. Mortarion grew to maturity on the world of Barbarus, a planet steeped in a toxic miasma where the Human population cowered in the dark lowlands, fearful of the overlords that preyed upon them from their mountaintop keeps deep within the fog.</p>
                    <p>History does not record who or what these beings truly were, but it is certain they were more than, or at least other than, Human. For one, they were able to breathe the deadly gases that made up the atmosphere of Barbarus, getting ever more deadly the higher the altitude, but they are said to have displayed other abilities too. The abominable masters of Barbarus were somehow able to enslave or dominate the ﬂesh of the dead, and they preyed upon the cringing natives in the valleys below, ever needful of raw material to fuel the endless wars they fought against one another.</p>
                    <p>The infant primarch was raised by one such overlord, Necare, the greatest of them all, who taught him the ways of war, yet would not answer his questions regarding the people who dwelled in the lowlands. When Mortarion defied his master and descended through the fog, which as a superhuman primarch he could breathe, he found people, like himself, if weaker and existing in perpetual terror of the overlords who preyed upon them each night.</p>
                    <p>Though they were initially suspicious of him, Mortarion proved himself one of their kind, and moulded them into an army that at first defied the hunting parties of the overlords, and then turned the tables upon them. At length, the only one left was he who had been Mortarion's master, the High Overlord Necare, residing so high in the toxic strata that not even Mortarion could pursue him.</p>
                    <p>When the Emperor came to Barbarus, the people greeted Him as their saviour, yet Mortarion was jealous and resentful of the adulation heaped upon this perfect stranger. Though his people could see that the Emperor was the primarch's sire, he himself saw only the differences. Where the stranger was noble of form and tanned of skin, Mortarion was pale and gaunt. When Mortarion refused to join Him, the Master of Mankind issued Mortarion a challenge -- if the primarch could defeat the last overlord of Barbarus, the Emperor would depart. If he could not, Mortarion must accept his fate and join the Great Crusade.</p>
                    <p>Mortarion accepted the Emperor's challenge and ascended into the toxic clouds, higher than he had ever travelled before. At length, he reached the grim keep of Necare and raged for the high overlord to face him. Yet, even the primarch's superhumanly enhanced body could not withstand the toxic concentration of the atmosphere at that altitude, but as he succumbed with Necare about to slay him, he saw the golden figure of the Emperor step between him and the high overlord, entirely unaffected by the poisonous air. With a single stroke of His mighty, flaming blade, the Emperor felled the last overlord of Barbarus, and Mortarion acceded to his fate. Yet the primarch found himself riddled with anger and resentment at his gene-father for stealing away what he believed to be his rightful vengeance.</p>
                    <p>Once the primarch was united with his Legion, it was found that the Death Guard, as they were renamed by their new master in memory of the army of the same name he had led against the overlords on Barbarus, were amongst the most resolute and resilient of all the Legions. Mortarion's warriors were ever to be found at the centre of the battle line, their strength and determination the inheritance of their primarch, making them the unbreakable core of any army of galactic conquest.</p>
                    <p>When the Horus Heresy plunged the galaxy into civil war and Mortarion joined himself and his Legion to the rebellion of the Warmaster Horus out of his unresolved anger at the Emperor, the warriors of the Death Guard found themselves becalmed in the Warp on their way to the Siege of Terra and assailed by Warp-born plagues so virulent that not even their legendary resilience could withstand them. Soon, the entire Legion was beset by a sickness that bloated their bellies with corpse gas, caused ﬂesh to slough from their bodies and made these strongest and toughest of warriors into crippled wretches assailed by delirium.</p>
                    <p>Though none can say exactly what forces acted upon the soul of the primarch of the Death Guard, whether he was already damned or whether he made his pact in some state of fever, he called out for deliverance, and his call must have been answered. When finally the Death Guard Legion's ﬂeet emerged from the Warp, its vessels and its warriors were entirely changed.</p>
                    <p>Their once-gleaming white and grey armour was stained with filth, and the noble warriors were transformed into walking hives of death and abomination. Worse still, the "Plague Marines" of the Death Guard were now hosts for the most virulent afﬂictions that their new patron, the Plague God Nurgle, could concoct. Condemned to a deathless state of eternal decay, the Death Guard would spread their pestilent diseases the length and breadth of the galaxy for the greater glory of Chaos.</p>
                    <p>With the end of the Horus Heresy, Mortarion led his Legion into the Eye of Terror, and while others had splintered into countless warbands, the Death Guard remained largely whole, thanks in no small part to their legendary strength and resilience. Mortarion brought them to a world that would become known simply as the Plague Planet, which he moulded into a new and despicable form, making it a virtual copy of lost Barbarus.</p>
                    <p>To this day, Mortarion's Death Guard launch their assaults through the Cadian Gate and into the galaxy beyond, sometimes in large bodies and at others lending strength to allied Chaos forces. Wherever they travel they spread the joyful, exuberant poxes of Nurgle, gifting those who would know eternal life with the choicest of the Plague God's blessings. There have been numerous occasions when previously unknown plagues have swept the defence lines of otherwise static Imperial fronts, followed solar hours later by an overwhelming enemy advance. Many amongst the Imperial high command ascribe such instances to the Death Guard, and are fearful of what vile diseases they might concoct next.</p>

                    <p class="quote">"The minds of gods are not for mortals to know, or to judge. Accept that Tzeentch has a place for all of us in his grand scheme, and be happy in the part you have to play."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— Proclamation of Magnus the Red</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Thousand Sons are one of the Traitor Legions of Chaos Space Marines who are sworn solely to the service of Tzeentch, the Chaos God of change, intrigue and sorcery, though they were once the Imperium of Man's XVth Legion of Space Marines. The main feature that distinguishes the Thousand Sons from the other Traitor Legions is the sheer number of psyker mutations that have always existed amongst the Space Marines in this Legion.</p>
                    <p>Every current member of the Legion possesses psychic abilities and they prefer to use Chaos Sorcerers and guile in combat, relying on their psychic powers and sorcerous knowledge to earn them victory.</p>
                    <p>As a result of an ancient spell known as the Rubric of Ahriman that was cast soon after the Thousand Sons fell from their homeworld of Prospero during the early days of the Horus Heresy, every Thousand Sons Astartes that lacked psychic powers had his soul fused directly into his power armour. The Thousand Sons have become living embodiments of sorcery animated by the power of Chaos and the will of the Lord of Change.</p>
                    <p>The Thousand Sons are the scions of the Primarch Magnus the Red, the copper-skinned cyclops whose thirst for knowledge in all its forms led ultimately to damnation and an eternity of servitude to Tzeentch, the Chaos God known as the Changer of the Ways. When the primarchs were scattered throughout the galaxy, Magnus found himself coming to rest upon the distant, isolated colony world of Prospero.</p>
                    <p>It was perhaps fortunate that a being that many other Human societies would have denounced as a mutant came to such a place. Prospero's only inhabitants were a population of outcast scholars and mystics, who had long since ﬂed the galaxy at large to establish a refuge where they could practise the arts of the psyker.</p>
                    <p>Raised by such scholars, Magnus learned and mastered every one of their arts, soon surpassing them in every regard. The primarch turned from pupil to master, his fearsomely powerful mind able to manipulate the raw power of the Warp in ways no others could.</p>
                    <p>By the time the Emperor located His long lost son, Magnus was privy to every secret the libraries of Prospero could offer. He yearned to learn more, and in his sire found the only being with more psychic potential than he. Accepting command of the Space Marine Legion created using his own gene-stock, Magnus took his place in the Great Crusade, and utilised his puissant skills for the good of all Mankind.</p>
                    <p>But all was not well with this state of affairs, for the Imperium of Man had been envisaged as an end to the superstitions that had benighted the isolated worlds of Mankind for so many long millennia. The worship of deities and fallacious spiritual doctrines was denounced by the Emperor's Iterators, who preached a new age of reason fuelled by the potential of Humanity itself and the doctrines of the Imperial Truth. Sorcery had no place in such a society, yet was not the Emperor the greatest of all psykers?</p>
                    <p>A great debate raged in the upper echelons of the nascent Imperium, driven by the need to explain and harness the phenomenon of psychic power whilst putting an end to sorcery and superstition. While still comparatively rare, the number of Humans being born with latent psychic powers was increasing, though it was nowhere near so prevalent as it is in the late 41st Millennium. The phenomenon proved all but impossible to explain using the empirical reasoning on which the Imperium was being built, and eventually, a great convocation of the highest ranked and wisest counsellors in the Imperium was called.</p>
                    <p>At this Council of Nikaea, those who denounced the use of psychic powers stated their case, the Emperor Himself enthroned in judgement. At length, Magnus came before the council, and gifted as he was of the intellect and charisma of a primarch, he refuted each of their points. Furthermore, Magnus stated convincingly his belief that no knowledge was in itself forbidden, so long as the scholar used it wisely.</p>
                    <p>Both parties having made their cases and the judgement appearing to hang in the balance, the Emperor made His decision, partially influenced by His anger towards Magnus' continued use of sorcery to bargain with the entities of the Warp despite the Emperor's repeated warnings to His son of the dangers that lay within the Immaterium.</p>
                    <p>The pursuit of psychic powers would be severely limited and strictly controlled, and any incarnation of ritual, superstition or incantation outlawed entirely. Magnus was furious, for the Emperor's pronouncement severely curtailed his Legion's activities, and denied them the use of their most potent weapons of war.</p>
                    <p>And so the Great Crusade continued onwards, but it later became apparent that Magnus had not ceased the pursuit of the forbidden arts at all, but rather had continued it beyond the sight of his peers. Most opposed of all his Brother Primarchs was Leman Russ, who regarded any form of guile used to defeat an enemy as a form of cowardice, and even after the pronouncements of Nikaea, a bitter resentment smouldered between the Legions. It was during the opening phase of the Horus Heresy that this resentment exploded into something far worse, with tragic consequences for the Imperium.</p>
                    <p>On the eve of the Warmaster Horus' treachery, Magnus is said to have experienced a vision in which he saw as no others could the full extent of the galactic civil war to come, and the part each primarch would come to play in it. He saw brother slaying brother and pacts being sealed with unspeakable beings. He saw the Ultramarines being unknowingly steered far beyond any hope of intervening, and worst of all, he saw what fate awaited the Emperor Himself.</p>
                    <p>Yet, the one thing Magnus could not see was his own role in the coming war, but he determined to intervene nonetheless. Magnus knew that in warning his sire of the coming treachery he would be admitting that he had disobeyed the edicts of Nikaea, yet he believed he had no choice.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, he saw that with events unfolding so fast, the only sure way of warning the Emperor was to project his consciousness across the void, breaching the psychic defences of the Imperial Palace, and to appear before his sire in spirit form. The primarch of the Thousand Sons issued his warning, but in so doing revealed his own crime.</p>
                    <p>In a stroke, Magnus was condemned by the Emperor, for his message had breached the psychic defences of the Imperial Palace and catastrophically destabilised the Emperor's Webway Project to build an Imperial extension into the Webway for Humanity. Terra itself was now at risk of daemonic invasion through the breach created by Magnus' folly.</p>
                    <p>The Space Wolves were despatched to Prospero by the Emperor to call the Thousand Sons to account and bring Magnus back to Terra to answer for his acts, yet what followed must surely have been far more destructive than any, even Magnus, could have foreseen. Manipulated by the Warmaster Horus, who was already plotting his rebellion against the Emperor, the Space Wolves fell upon Prospero as savage barbarians, unleashing their bestial anger on the Thousand Sons and all of their works.</p>
                    <p>The delicate silver towers of the so-called City of Light, Tizca, were cast down as brother fought brother, savage fought scholar and warrior fought mystic. At the height of the destruction, Leman Russ and Magnus met one another in bitter conﬂict, and ultimately, Russ proved the stronger of the brother primarchs.</p>
                    <p>Yet, at the very moment of Russ' triumph, Magnus uttered a word of power and caused himself, and the City of Light, to vanish from the surface of Prospero, disappearing into the Warp to reappear later within the depths of the Eye of Terror on what would come to be known as Sortiarius, the Planet of the Sorcerers.</p>
                    <p>Given the heritage of their primarch, it can be no surprise that the Thousand Sons Legion was always prone to mutation. Prior to the Heresy, stringent purity checks and relentless discipline had kept mutation at bay whilst simultaneously developing psychic power. Having steeped themselves in the raw power of Chaos, however, the Thousand Sons fell prey to rampant and uncontrolled mutation, to such an extent that a cabal of the Legion's senior Librarians, led by their chief, Ahriman, determined that something drastic must be done to save the Legion from complete dissolution.</p>
                    <p>With Magnus retired to the highest tower of his reshaped City of Light, his mystic, all-seeing gaze cast bitterly upon the dimensions without, Ahriman and his cabal set about enacting a mighty spell that would purge the Legion of mutation and impurity, and leave behind a body of utterly purified warriors.</p>
                    <p>Ahriman cast his rubric, and the skies over the Planet of the Sorcerers erupted in an etheric storm of unprecedented proportions. Bolts of power formed from the raw stuff of the Warp arced from the roiling clouds, each striking a battle-brother of the Thousand Sons, until all but Magnus in his tower and the cabal of sorcerers had been scoured by the mighty rubric.</p>
                    <p>But when the storm receded, Ahriman saw the awful truth of what he had wrought. Instead of purging the ﬂesh of ravening mutations, each of the Thousand Sons who lacked psychic power had been transformed. The seals and joints of their power armour had been welded shut, and the body within turned to ashes. What remained was a suit of animated armour, devoid of mutation, but of all independent will as well.</p>
                    <p>When Magnus the Red saw what Ahriman had done, he turned his back, ascended his tower and turned his gaze upon the Imperium. In that moment he knew that everything he had ever striven towards was now, quite literally, ashes.</p>
                    <p>Some say that Magnus resides in his Silver Tower still, his baleful gaze sweeping the domains of Mankind in search of the means of enacting his final vengeance. While their Daemon Primarch broods upon the total annihilation of his enemies, the Sorcerers of the Thousand Sons lead their automaton warriors, their Rubricae, the length and breadth of the galaxy, wielding the power of Tzeentch and enacting the schemes of their master upon the Imperium.</p>

                    <p class="reference">— Canticle of the Warped Becoming, from the Liber Idolator</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Chaos Knights, also known as Renegade Knights, Daemon Knights, and the Questor Traitoris in High Gothic, are Imperial Knight combat walkers, their Fallen Noble pilots and Knight houses corrupted to the service of Chaos.</p>
                    <p>Humanoid war engines that tower over their foes, each Chaos Knight carries an army's worth of firepower upon its weaponised limbs and hulking carapace.</p>
                    <p>At close quarters, their roaring Reaper Chainswords and crushing Thunderstrike Gauntlets destroy what their trampling feet cannot, scattering terrified survivors before their unstoppable advance. The ground shudders beneath the godlike tread of the Renegade Knights.</p>
                    <p>Even one such looming war engine possesses the firepower to annihilate entire regiments of enemy warriors, pick apart armoured columns, and swat squadrons of aircraft from the skies. Chaos Lords and rebellious demagogues will go to great lengths to secure the services of such a lone warrior, sacrificing whatever they must to ensure that this god of destruction fights at their side.</p>
                    <p>Deployed in great number, the Questor Traitoris are more fearsome still, and have been known to bring entire worlds to heel, scourging them by blade and flame in the name of the Dark Gods.</p>
                    <p>Each Chaos Knight is an unhallowed relic of Humanity's ancient past. They are twisted reflections of the Imperial Knights, corrupted in form and spirit by fell sorceries, dark worship and malefic re-engineering. The Knight suits were first created using Standard Template Construct databases during the Age of Technology, and many have survived through the innumerable wars that have characterised the long Terran millennia since.</p>
                    <p>For generations uncounted, the colossal war machines have been piloted by Nobles -- aristocratic warriors possessed of enough physical, mental and spiritual fortitude to survive the Ritual of Becoming, commune with the Throne Mechanicum at each walker's heart and thus bond with their Knight suit.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Chaos Knights, such rituals are tainted by Warp entities, malefic sorceries and the perversions of the Nobles themselves. At first, the Knight may appear unchanged, but in its core the irrevocable process of rot has already begun.</p>
                    <p>Over Terran years or even centuries, Chaos energies seep into the war engine, torturing its Machine Spirit and mutating its mechanical form. Where once the suit and its pilot were a gleaming beacon of Imperial honour, the Chaos Knight and its Fallen Noble comprise a symbiotic beast of unfettered wrath and base hatred.</p>
                    <p>A Noble is enabled to pilot their war machine by being wired into an arcane contraption that is implanted into their Knight's cockpit -- a Throne Mechanicum in the larger Knights, or a Helm Mechanicum in the smaller classes. Neural jacks and cerebral uplinks connect the pilot's nervous system to the device, allowing them to directly interface with the machinery of their steed.</p>
                    <p>Actuators and omni-motivators are driven by streams of hateful thoughts, whilst sensory information and multi-spectrum Auspex relays feed back into the Noble's mind with burning clarity. Within each Throne Mechanicum are the spectral neural echoes of its previous pilots, screaming techno-gheists whose suffering increases exponentially as the Knight to which they are bonded grows ever more warped.</p>
                    <p>Only the most indomitable Fallen Nobles are able to commune with a Throne Mechanicum. Those that do are able to spur their Chaos Knight into action by inimical will alone. Nobles who are wired into a Helm Mechanicum are similarly twisted by Chaos energies that have been absorbed by their war engine. The Helms also yoke these pilots mind and soul to the will of their Knightly overlords.</p>
                    <p>Since the Horus Heresy, thousands of individual Knights and even whole Knight houses have fallen to Chaos. Each instance of treachery is a monumental blow to the Imperium. The Nobles and their Knight suits are not only crucial cogs in Humanity's war machine, they are considered to be among the most unshakeably loyal servants of the Emperor.</p>
                    <p>The mere suggestion that a Noble could forswear their vows and fight against the Imperium's servants is tantamount to blasphemy. It is whispered that the Departmento Munitorum has had Imperial officers executed for heresy rather than acknowledge their claims that they have done battle with turncoat Nobles. Yet the terrifying reality is that Chaos Knights bent on anarchy and slaughter march upon the Emperor's realm in ever-greater numbers.</p>
                    <p>Fallen Nobles embark on campaigns of destruction for many reasons. Some do so to conquer territory in the name of the baleful deities they worship. Others have sworn fealty to the Dark Mechanicum, the Heretic Astartes or powerful daemonic entities, and answer the dread summons of war whenever they are called upon.</p>
                    <p>Others still are driven by insanity and profane visions, launching quests to upend the very fabric of existence and transform the galaxy into a twisted hellscape.</p>
                    <p>Chaos Knights are able to cover enormous distances when battling across a planet, marching unhindered through toxic atmospheres and across irradiated continents to reach their enemies. When their wars stretch beyond a single world, many of their kind use corrupted Dark Mechanicum Explorator craft and mass conveyance barges to transport themselves to the front lines. On the most Warp-drenched battlefields, the horrific war engines have even been known to storm forth from tears in reality, emerging from local Warp rifts called into being by the powers of Chaos.</p>
                    <p>A single Chaos Knight has as much resilience and firepower as a small army. Those that have turned upon or even butchered the rest of their Knightly household are termed Dreadblades by the Ordo Hereticus. They typically operate as lone wolves and mercenaries, lending their immense might to heretical warlords in exchange for powerful relics, arcane knowledge or fief planets upon which they can enact their cruelties.</p>
                    <p>Dreadblades are often followed into battle by hordes of warriors, Chaos Space Marines who revere the Knights' destructive potential, and throngs of Chaos Cultists who worship the machines as manifestations of their Dark Gods' will. At other times, multiple Dreadblades will gather together, focusing their disparate fury towards a single malefic purpose.</p>
                    <p>But even more terrifying than the individualistic Dreadblades are the Knight houses that have fallen in their entirety to Chaos. Those that have sided with Traitor Titan Legions and the Dark Mechanicum are known as "Infernal houses" in the Imperium. They use techno-sorcery and summoned daemonic entities to bolster the already formidable capabilities of their Knight suits.</p>
                    <p>Other Knightly courts, known as "Iconoclast houses," have more varied heretical allegiances; some have maintained oaths of fealty to Heretic Astartes Legions or the Dark Gods themselves, whereas others have renounced their allegiance to the Imperium to carve out their own dread empires.</p>

                    <p class="quote">"There is a terrible darkness descending upon the galaxy, and we shall not see it ended in our lifetimes."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— Inquisitor Bronislaw Czevak at the Conclave of Har</p>
                    <p><br><br>The Necrons are a mysterious xenos species of humanoid, robotic skeletal warriors that have lain dormant in their stasis-tombs for more than 60 million Terran years, though they have begun to awaken at last. They are the soulless creations, former servants and now the captors of the ancient C'tan, the terrible Star Gods of Aeldari myth.</p>
                    <p>The Necrons are ancient beyond reckoning, predating even the birth of the Aeldari. At long last, however, they are beginning to awaken from their Tomb Worlds, for the galaxy is ripe for conquest and the restoration of the Necron Empire since the disappearance of the Old Ones more than 60 million standard years ago.</p>
                    <p>The Necrons are a completely robotic humanoid species whose technological prowess is probably unmatched by any of the other intelligent species of the galaxy. Yet out of a desire for vengeance against the more fortunate, long-lived, ancient xenos people called the Old Ones, and the trickery of the godlike intelligences known as the C'tan, the Necrons shed their original organic forms and lost all forms of compassion and empathy.</p>
                    <p>They have become instead ruthless, undying killing machines who are determined to exert their mastery over the galaxy once more. Across the galaxy, this ancient and terrible species is stirring back to life. Entombed in stasis-crypts for millions of Terran years, they have slumbered through the aeons, waiting for the galaxy to heal from the wounds of a long and bloody war.</p>
                    <p>Now, after sixty million standard years of dormancy, a great purpose begins. On desolate worlds thought long-bereft of all life, ancient machineries wake into grim purpose, commencing the slow process of revivification that will see those entombed within freed to stride across the stars once again. The unstoppable, undying Necron legions are rising. Let the galaxy beware.</p>
                    <p>All Necrons, from the lowliest of warriors to the most regal of lords, are driven by one ultimate goal, to restore their ancient ruling dynasties to glory and to bring the galaxy under their rule once more, as it was in ancient days.</p>
                    <p>Such was the edict long ago encoded into the Necrons' minds, and it is a command so fundamental to their being that it cannot be denied. Yet it is no small task, for the Necrons are awakening from their Tomb Worlds to find the galaxy of the 41st Millennium as recorded by the Imperial Calendar much changed.</p>
                    <p>Many Tomb Worlds are no more, destroyed by cosmic disaster or alien invasion. Others are damaged, their entombed legions afflicted by slow madness or worn to dust by entropy's irresistible onset.</p>
                    <p>Degenerate alien species squat amongst the ruins of those Necron Tomb Worlds that remain, little aware of the greatness they defile with their upstart presence. Yet there is no salvation to be found in such ignorance. The undying have come to reclaim their lands, and the living shall be swept aside.</p>
                    <p>Yet if billions of Necrons have been destroyed by the passage of eternity, countless billions more remain to see their dominion reborn. They are not creatures of flesh and blood, these Necrons, but android warriors whose immortal forms are forged from living metal. As such, they are almost impervious to destruction, and their mechanical bodies are swift to heal even the gravest wounds.</p>
                    <p>Given time, severed limbs reattach, armour plating reknits and shattered mechanical organs are rebuilt. The only way, then, to assure a Necron's destruction is to overwhelm its ability to self-repair, to inflict such massive damage that its ancient regenerative systems cannot keep pace.</p>
                    <p>Even then, should irreparable damage occur, the Necron will often simply "phase out" -- an automated viridian teleportation beam returning it to the safety of the stasis-crypts, where it remains in storage until such time as repairs can be carried out.</p>
                    <p>The sciences by which such feats are achieved remain a mystery to outsiders, for the Necrons do not share their secrets with lesser species and have set contingencies to prevent their supreme technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Should a fallen Necron warrior fail to phase out, it self-destructs and is consumed in a blaze of emerald light.</p>
                    <p>Outwardly, this appears little different to the glow of teleportation, leaving the foe to wonder whether the Necron has finally been destroyed or has merely retreated to its tomb. Victory over the Necrons is therefore always a tenuous thing, and a hard-won battle grants little surety of ultimate victory.</p>
                    <p>For the Necrons, defeats are minor inconveniences -- the preludes to future triumphs, nothing more. Immortality has brought patience; the perils that the Necrons survived in ancient times carry the lesson their people can overcome any opposition, if they have but the will to try. And if the Necrons possess only a single trait, it is a will as unbending as adamantium.</p>
                    <p>Only one hope can now preserve the other intelligent species of the galaxy from the Necrons' advance, from the endless legions of silent and deathless warriors rising from long-forgotten tombs. If the Necrons can be prevented from waking to their full glory, if the scattered Tomb Worlds can be prevented from unifying, then there is a chance of survival.</p>
                    <p>If not, then the great powers of the galaxy will surely fall, and the Necrons shall rule supreme for all eternity -- undying, cruel and utterly implacable.</p>
